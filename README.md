# Education Program insight

This project analyzes student attendance at workshops on software development, new technologies, and material prototyping for students from sixth to eleventh grade in some schools in Medell√≠n. The project includes a decision tree that predicts which students are more likely to attend the four-session workshop.

7. Model Performance


## Dataset

The data was collected in situ during the development of the workshops. It includes demographic and participation-related information for each student, such as age group, grade level, attendance per session, and whether they completed the full four-session workshop (assistance_4_attendance). This dataset enables the analysis and prediction of student engagement patterns across multiple workshop events.


## Results

The decision tree model predicts which students are more likely to complete the four-session workshop. It achieved an accuracy of 66.3%, with strong performance in identifying attendees (recall = 0.80). The model is useful for targeting engaged participants, though less effective at detecting non-attendance.

## Requirements

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
